vtiger CRM 1.0
August 26, 2004

-=Overview=-

After several months of working on our CRM solution, based on Apache, MySQL and other open source components, we came across a SourceForge open source project initiated by SugarCRM, having the same vision, and doing something very similar to what we were doing. They started out with the same premise we did, namely that CRM software is needlessly expensive, and hosted offerings only pretend to be affordable. While we were getting ready with our offering, the open source project had already launched it; the underlying infrastructure of Apache and MySQL was similar to what we were doing, and most importantly, the SugarCRM Public License allowed us to create distributions based on this code (SPL - a copy of Version 1.1.2 is found here, and the URL is at http://www.sugarcrm.com/home/content/view/35/86/) we decided it would be even faster to adopt that as our core and add value on top, an example of open source based collaboration.

We gratefully acknowledge the contribution made by SugarCRM, and we intend to actively participate and lead in bringing this vision of affordable enterprise applications, but we make it clear that vtiger is not affiliated with nor is endorsed by SugarCRM.

The team at vtiger CRM is pleased to announce the v1.0 the first release of vtiger CRM Open Source project.

This first release of vtiger.Sales is best suited for small sales forces.  If
you're looking to manage the basics of sales deals where every user can see
all of the data in the system, then vtiger.Sales v1.0 is right for you.  Over the next few months, we will be building out vtiger.Sales to meet the needs of larger, multi-national sales forces that need features like forecasting, data access permissions and internationalization.

Please feel free to send your valuable comments to contact@vtiger.com so that we can have a better CRM product at free of cost. Check out our website at http://www.vtiger.com for support forums, detailed product information, our future plan and much more.
